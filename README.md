# hello-world
The first step to familiarize myself with GitHub

I am currently taking a Coursera course called "The Data Scientist's Toolbox."
Thus far, I have found it extremely helpful. 

I promise myself to dedicate my "free" time in Summer 2020 to study and master at least 2 programming languages, namely R and Python. Cheers to the first day of being committed! I trust that you can commit yourself to learning and obtaining these programming skills, Khanh.
